ACT I
SCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace.

    Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and Attendants 

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Escalus.

ESCALUS

    My lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Of government the properties to unfold,
    Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
    Since I am put to know that your own science
    Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
    My strength can give you: then no more remains,
    But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,
    And let them work. The nature of our people,
    Our city's institutions, and the terms
    For common justice, you're as pregnant in
    As art and practise hath enriched any
    That we remember. There is our commission,
    From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
    I say, bid come before us Angelo.

    Exit an Attendant
    What figure of us think you he will bear?
    For you must know, we have with special soul
    Elected him our absence to supply,
    Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
    And given his deputation all the organs
    Of our own power: what think you of it?

ESCALUS

    If any in Vienna be of worth
    To undergo such ample grace and honour,
    It is Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Look where he comes.

    Enter ANGELO

ANGELO

    Always obedient to your grace's will,
    I come to know your pleasure.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Angelo,
    There is a kind of character in thy life,
    That to the observer doth thy history
    Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
    Are not thine own so proper as to waste
    Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
    Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
    Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
    Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
    As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
    But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
    The smallest scruple of her excellence
    But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
    Herself the glory of a creditor,
    Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
    To one that can my part in him advertise;
    Hold therefore, Angelo:--
    In our remove be thou at full ourself;
    Mortality and mercy in Vienna
    Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
    Though first in question, is thy secondary.
    Take thy commission.

ANGELO

    Now, good my lord,
    Let there be some more test made of my metal,
    Before so noble and so great a figure
    Be stamp'd upon it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    No more evasion:
    We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
    Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
    Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
    That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
    Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
    As time and our concernings shall importune,
    How it goes with us, and do look to know
    What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
    To the hopeful execution do I leave you
    Of your commissions.

ANGELO

    Yet give leave, my lord,
    That we may bring you something on the way.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    My haste may not admit it;
    Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
    With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
    So to enforce or qualify the laws
    As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
    I'll privily away. I love the people,
    But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
    Through it do well, I do not relish well
    Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
    Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
    That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

ANGELO

    The heavens give safety to your purposes!

ESCALUS

    Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!

DUKE

    I thank you. Fare you well.

    Exit

ESCALUS

    I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
    To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
    To look into the bottom of my place:
    A power I have, but of what strength and nature
    I am not yet instructed.

ANGELO

    'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
    And we may soon our satisfaction have
    Touching that point.

ESCALUS

    I'll wait upon your honour.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A Street.

    Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen 

LUCIO

    If the duke with the other dukes come not to
    composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
    the dukes fall upon the king.

First Gentleman

    Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
    Hungary's!

Second Gentleman

    Amen.

LUCIO

    Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
    went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
    one out of the table.

Second Gentleman

    'Thou shalt not steal'?

LUCIO

    Ay, that he razed.

First Gentleman

    Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and
    all the rest from their functions: they put forth
    to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
    the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
    well that prays for peace.

Second Gentleman

    I never heard any soldier dislike it.

LUCIO

    I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
    grace was said.

Second Gentleman

    No? a dozen times at least.

First Gentleman

    What, in metre?

LUCIO

    In any proportion or in any language.

First Gentleman

    I think, or in any religion.

LUCIO

    Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
    controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
    wicked villain, despite of all grace.

First Gentleman

    Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.

LUCIO

    I grant; as there may between the lists and the
    velvet. Thou art the list.

First Gentleman

    And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
    a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
    be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
    art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
    feelingly now?

LUCIO

    I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
    feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
    confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
    live, forget to drink after thee.

First Gentleman

    I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

Second Gentleman

    Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.

LUCIO

    Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
    have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--

Second Gentleman

    To what, I pray?

LUCIO

    Judge.

Second Gentleman

    To three thousand dolours a year.

First Gentleman

    Ay, and more.

LUCIO

    A French crown more.

First Gentleman

    Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
    art full of error; I am sound.
